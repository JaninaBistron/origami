GeoGami is a location-based game that allows the user to play and create map-based games - for any place in the world. GeoGami is intended for users to improve and develop their spatial intelligence by improving their orientation skills and cognition. It is created by the Spatial Intelligence Lab (SIL) of the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster.

For more information on **GeoGami** and our **research** visit the [Website](https://geogami.ifgi.de). It's available in both English and German.

## Run the app

GeoGami runs on both iOS and Android devices with a compass sensor and a GPS or GSM module. The app is still under development and it would be helpful if you all contribute by reporting bugs and functional limitations here: [issues](https://github.com/origami-team/origami/issues).

You can install GeoGami...

1. **on your iOS device:** [Visit App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geogami/id1614864078).
2. **on your Android device:** [Visit Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifgi.geogami).
