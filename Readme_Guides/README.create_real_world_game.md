# how to create Real World Game in GeoGami.

The GeoGami games that you can find in our games database so far have been created by the GeoGami users themselves. 
You can create your own game for your location. Choose from different task types, add photos and audio recordings and adapt the map to your needs. 

To do that you need to install GeoGami and register as a User in GeoGami. This can be done by entering your email id in the login section.
